# Frequently Asked Questions

Below is a list of questions new users might often raise as they explore the system


## General

### Something is wrong! What do I do?

{: .question}
This depends on what the problem is exactly! See [Troubleshooting](./troubleshooting).

### I bought this but I don't see any content!

{: .question}
See the page on [Buying, Registering, Installing, and Activating Premium Content](./premium)

## Usage

### How do I start character creation?

{: .question}
The first step is simply creating a blank **Agent** type Actor and give Owner permission to a Player. That player then needs to just drag and drop the desired **Archetype** Item onto the Actor to begin the process. Note that the player needs access to to those Archetypes, and for official modules this should be the case by default if accessing via the Compendium. If the Archetypes have been imported into the world, they may need to be given permission to view them. 

### I'm dragging an Archetype onto the Actor but nothing is happening, what's wrong?

{: .question}
You're likely trying to drag the Journal Page that describes that Archetype. Make sure you're using **Items**, either from the Compendium or ones that have been imported.
